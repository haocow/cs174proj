For our term project, we implemented a music visualizer.  Sound files are read and played using a library, and values denoting different frequencies of the sound are extracted and used to adjust objects in time with the music.

The user is able to use keyboard controls to adjust the camera to move around the perimeter of the world enclosing the visualizer.

All aspects of the course material up to and including texture mapping are included.
